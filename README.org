** Description
Essentially this program tries to recreate the functionality offered
by websites such as [[http://redditplayer.phoenixforgotten.com/][Reddit Playlister]]. It improves upon the concept by
not requiring Flash and by allowing the user to listen to the music
with any music player that supports the Extended M3U
format. Compatibility with music players is further improved by not
relying on them to be able to play certain urls (eg. VLC can play
youtube urls). Instead youtube-dl is used to grab the media urls which
are then put in the M3U file.
